    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Rick Hansen's life up to this point:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>August 26, 1957</strong> - Born in Port Alberni, British Columbia</li>
      <li>
        <strong>June 27, 1973</strong> - Rick and a friend were riding in the back of a pickup truck when the driver lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree. The impact threw Rick and his friend from the vehicle, resulting in a spinal injury that left Rick paralyzed from the waist down
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1980</strong> - Wheelchair racing at the Summer Paralympics
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1984</strong> - Wheelchair racing at the Summer Paralympics
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>March 21, 1985</strong> - He embarked on his Man in Motion World Tour from Oakridge Mall in Vancouver. Although public attention was low at the beginning of the tour, he soon attracted international media attention as he progressed on a 26-month trek, logging 40,075 km through 34 countries on four continents (North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia) before crossing Canada. He averaged 8 hours of wheeling and 85 km a day. His highest summit was in the Swiss Alps at 5,577 ft. He returned to Vancouver's BC Place Stadium to cheering crowds of thousands on May 22, 1987 after raising $26 million for spinal cord research and quality of life initiatives. Like Terry Fox, he was hailed as an international hero.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1988</strong> - The Hansen Foundation was established in 1988, following the completion of Rick Hansen's Man in Motion World Tour, to continue raising funds and awareness to create a world without barriers for people with disabilities. For nearly 30 years, the Foundation has been actively improving the lives of people with disabilities, changing perceptions and breaking down barriers. The vision of the organization is to create an inclusive world where people with disabilities can reach their full potential. Through programs, collaboration and leadership, the Foundation has increased awareness and solutions for the barriers people with disabilities face, created more accessible spaces, improved the quality of life and health outcomes for people with spinal cord injuries, mobility issues and other disabilities.<br />
    <br />
In addition, the Foundation operates three major programs. The Rick Hansen School Program is designed for students from grades one to twelve, and teaches inclusiveness, disability awareness and leadership.[9] Meanwhile, an online accessibility-related travel tool and consumer ratings guide called planat was also launched in 2011.[10][11] The Foundation also provides Quality of Life grants to recipients every year.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2011 and 2012</strong> - The Foundation was also part of a cross-Canada tour called the Rick Hansen 25th Anniversary Relay that followed the same route as Hansen's original Man in Motion Tour, roughly 25 years after it began.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>November 15, 2017</strong> - WE Charity and the Rick Hansen Foundation launched a joint venture to advocate for increased accessibility throughout Canada. The initiative was announced as part of WE Day Ottawa, on this day. The goal of the initiative is to make every building in Canada fully accessible within 30 years. As part of this effort, RHF developed a program to evaluate and promote accessibility across Canada. The program was added to WE Schools curriculum in over 14,500 schools across Canada, the U.S. and the UK.

        <q>I honestly believe that my best work is in front, not behind me.

I am driven by a deep passion and need to make a difference and leave this world a little better than when I arrived.

That's what keeps me going.</q>
